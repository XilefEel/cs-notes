# Get Started

Hello everyone! 👋  
Welcome to my personal digital garden and study reference for my **Data Structures** course, built using Markdown and VitePress.

Each data structure is covered in both C and Rust. Why? Well because I'm currently learning both C and Rust but more importantly, I believe that learning the same concepts through two different languages provides a more "3D" understanding. The goal isn't to memorize syntax, but to actually understand how data structures work under the hood.

## Disclaimer

- This is just a study reference, not a comprehensive textbook.
- I'm not an expert in C or Rust and I'm still learning alongside you. The code and explanations reflect my current understanding and may not always follow best practices.
- If you spot a bug or have a better way to explain a concept, feel free to share and discuss it with me!
